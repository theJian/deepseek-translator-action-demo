# deepseek-translator-action-demo

This is for demonstrate how to use the [deepseek-translator](https://github.com/theJian/deepseek-translator) GitHub Action in a workflow.
Making changes to locale source file `locales/en.json` will trigger the action to run and update the translations in other locale files, and create a pull request.
